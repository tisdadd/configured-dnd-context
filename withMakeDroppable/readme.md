# withMakeDroppable Higher Order Component

This Higher Order Component will handle making droppable components. The project this whole context was created for is using this combined with `withMakeDraggable` and sortable contexts to create a structure of multiple lists with some fields being able to be copied into fields of other lists.

- index.ts - For easier import elsewhere
- withMakeDroppable.attachesPropTypes.ts - Prop types that this will attach
- withMakeDroppable.stories.tsx - Stories for this HOC
- withMakeDroppable.test.ts - The tests for this HOC
- withMakeDroppable.tsx - The actual HOC
