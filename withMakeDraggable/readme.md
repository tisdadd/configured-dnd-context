# withMakeDraggable Higher Order Component

This context wrapping HOC will provide access to the MakeDraggableContext. The project this whole context was created for is using this combined with `withMakeDraggable` and sortable contexts to create a structure of multiple lists with some fields being able to be copied into fields of other lists.

- index.ts - For easier import elsewhere
- withMakeDraggable.attachesPropTypes.ts - Prop types that this will attach
- withMakeDraggable.stories.tsx - Stories for this HOC
- withMakeDraggable.test.ts - The tests for this HOC
- withMakeDraggable.tsx - The actual HOC
